Sure! I need more friends, so feel free to interact! I prefer to use whispers, so keep that in mind.
> I do not have an extensive, specific DNI list of my own, only the basic DNI criteria. If you do not know what that is, check out "basic-dni.crd.co/" or look up "basic DNI citeria". Other than that, go on ahead {unless D.N.I.uF or similar things are in my name, of course -w-}!

## I LOVE FNAF OH MY GOD PLEASE DEBATE THEORIES, HEADCANONS, AND MORE WITH ME

> I admittedly do not know much about the newer games, I was a bit disappointed in Security Breach's turn of direction {not that I don't like it now, it's okay I guess.} and fell a bit out of love with the series after because of it. Feel free to educate me and change my mind, though!
