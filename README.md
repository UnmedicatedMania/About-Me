># Can you interact with me?
Sure! I need more friends, so feel free to interact! I prefer to use whispers, so keep that in mind.
> I do not have an extensive, specific DNI list of my own, only the basic DNI criteria. If you do not know what that is, check out "basic-dni.crd.co/" or look up "basic DNI citeria". Other than that, go on ahead {unless D.N.I.uF or similar things are in my name, of course -w-}!

## BYI

-> I am a part of a system^^! That should be obvious with my 'about' section but still.
~ Yes, my source is the Bonnie tormentor. No, I am not a 'fictkin'. Yes, you can call me Mark or whatever you call your AU, but I heavily prefer Daxel!

-> This is also in my about section, but I would like to explain it further:  
- Please refrain from interacting with me in an Afton skin. This is with **no** exceptions to William, Elizabeth, and Mrs. Afton. I'm typically fine with Michael and his brother interacting, but please do so with caution.  
I have my personal reasons for this, and it's a bit difficult to explain, so please respect it.. But I will say I don't mind if you're in an Afton skin once I get to know you!
> Yes, I know this comes off as odd or cringey, but I don't really care

## I LOVE FNAF OH MY GOD PLEASE DEBATE THEORIES, HEADCANONS, AND MORE WITH ME
> -> by debate i mean <ins>debate</ins> not argue waa ... [sad]
> I admittedly do not know much about the newer games, I was a bit disappointed in Security Breach's turn of direction {not that I don't like it now, it's okay I guess.} and fell a bit out of love with the series after because of it. Feel free to educate me and change my mind, though!
